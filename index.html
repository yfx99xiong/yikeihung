The center of my current research experience is corroborated with interdisciplinary knowledge in Geographic Information Systems, Mathematics, Statistics,<BR> 
Computer Science, and Environmental SciencesÂ to solve real-life problems. My recent project is focused on the health condition of low-income family related<BR>

Personal Life</a>
</li>
<p>
In my spare time, I love traveling to different places. I also enjoy music and dance. Before I came to the States, I had one-year pre-professional training<BR>
in Chinese dance. After I changed to a new environment, my love of dance also has pushed me to explore new fields such as ballet, jazz, hip-hop, and modern dance.<BR>
