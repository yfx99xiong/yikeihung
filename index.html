I am going to complete my B.S in Mathematics at Penn State on December 2020. During my undergraduate study, I have built solid mathematical foundation and
                                       also have developed various interests in other fields, such as Geography, Statistics, and Dance performing. </p>

<p class="ex">
The center of my current research experience is corroborated with interdisciplinary knowledge in Geographic Information Systems, Mathematics, Statistics,
Computer Science, and Environmental SciencesÂ to solve real-life problems. My recent project is focused on the health condition of low-income family related
to food dessert area. I am preparing data for this project.</p>

  <dt><b><a href="494.pdf">Traffic Prediction using Internet of Things Sensors and Deep Learning</a></b>&nbsp;|| Supervised by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geog.psu.edu/directory/manzhu-yu">Dr. Manzhu Yu</a>, Department of Geography</dt>
  <dd>- <i>Abstract:</i> 
  Traffic prediction has been proved to be one of the scientific and efficient solutions to avoid congestion. <BR> 
  The characteristics of complexity and nonlinearity of large-scale traffic data make the traditional prediction <BR> 
  methods useless. This case study focuses on using the Internet of Things (IoT)  and Spatio-Temporal Graph <BR> 
  Convolutional Networks (STGCN), a Deep learning framework, to predict traffic speed in the New York City. <BR> 
  Our experiment result shows that the STGCN can obtain both spatial and temporal feature for traffic data set, <BR> 
  and it also have strong ability to carry out fast train with high prediction accuracy.</dd>

  <dt><b><a href="462.pdf">Ames Housing Price Prediction</a></b></dt>
  <dd>- Since housing price is one of the indexes for the economy, the goal of this project is to select important features <BR> 
  for predicting housing prices and to find which model can achieve better performance. </dd>

  <dt><b><a href="462Group.pdf">Red Wine Quality Prediction</a></b>(Group Project)</dt> 
  <dd>- <i>Abstract:</i> 
  ...food quality assurance is a time-consuming and expensive task, since food processing is complicated and will <BR>
  change over time, which means we do not know the final result until all processing steps finish. Therefore, people<BR>
  introduce several technological methods to predict food quality. This project targets red wine quality prediction. <BR>
  Since wine drinking has been proven to have a protective effect on heart diseases, increasing wine consumption <BR>
  brings the problem of how to produce good quality wine within a shorter time at lower cost....By examining the <BR>
  importance of each chemical parameters in the wine, we would be able to know how these variables influence the <BR>
  accuracy of regression and machine learning models that implement in this project and the method to improve wine quality.<BR></dd>

<p class="ex">
In my spare time, I love traveling to different places. I also enjoy music and dance. Before I came to the States, I had one-year pre-professional training
in Chinese dance. After I changed to a new environment, my love of dance also has pushed me to explore new fields such as ballet, jazz, hip-hop, and modern dance.
