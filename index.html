    <h2>Website Design Workshop</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of this workshop is to enable students to have professional websites that they can update and publish them through the university. The easiest way to do this (in my opinion) is to select a template based on the overall appearence, download it, and edit the html directly to adjust for your content.
