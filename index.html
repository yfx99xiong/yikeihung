I am going to complete my B.S in Mathematics at Penn State on December 2020. During my undergraduate study, I have built solid mathematical foundation and
                                       also have developed various interests in other fields, such as Geography, Statistics, and Dance performing. </p>

Project Experience</font></li>
<p class="ex">
The center of my current research experience is corroborated with interdisciplinary knowledge in Geographic Information Systems, Mathematics, Statistics,
Computer Science, and Environmental SciencesÂ to solve real-life problems. My recent project is focused on the health condition of low-income family related
to food dessert area. I am preparing data for this project.</p>

Here are some highlights from my past works: </p>

  <dt><b>   <p class="ex"><a href="494.pdf">Traffic Prediction using Internet of Things Sensors and Deep Learning</a></b>&nbsp;|| Supervised by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geog.psu.edu/directory/manzhu-yu">Dr. Manzhu Yu</a>, Department of Geography</dt>
  <dd>   - <i>Abstract:</i> 
  Traffic prediction has been proved to be one of the scientific and efficient solutions to avoid congestion. 
  The characteristics of complexity and nonlinearity of large-scale traffic data make the traditional prediction 
  methods useless. This case study focuses on using the Internet of Things (IoT)  and Spatio-Temporal Graph 
  Convolutional Networks (STGCN), a Deep learning framework, to predict traffic speed in the New York City. 
  Our experiment result shows that the STGCN can obtain both spatial and temporal feature for traffic data set, 
  and it also have strong ability to carry out fast train with high prediction accuracy.</p></dd>
  <dt><b>   <p class="ex"><a href="462.pdf">Ames Housing Price Prediction</a></b></dt>
  <dd>- Since housing price is one of the indexes for the economy, the goal of this project is to select important features 
  for predicting housing prices and to find which model can achieve better performance. </p></dd>
  <dt><b> <p class="ex"><a href="462Group.pdf">Red Wine Quality Prediction </a></b>(Group Project)</dt> 
  <dd>- <i>Abstract:</i> 
  ...food quality assurance is a time-consuming and expensive task, since food processing is complicated and will 
  change over time, which means we do not know the final result until all processing steps finish. Therefore, people
  introduce several technological methods to predict food quality. This project targets red wine quality prediction. 
  Since wine drinking has been proven to have a protective effect on heart diseases, increasing wine consumption 
  brings the problem of how to produce good quality wine within a shorter time at lower cost....By examining the 
  importance of each chemical parameters in the wine, we would be able to know how these variables influence the 
  accuracy of regression and machine learning models that implement in this project and the method to improve wine quality.</p></dd>

<p class="ex">
In my spare time, I love traveling to different places. I also enjoy music and dance. Before I came to the States, I had one-year pre-professional training
in Chinese dance. After I changed to a new environment, my love of dance also has pushed me to explore new fields such as ballet, jazz, hip-hop, and modern dance.
